# TravelTime+
## What is it?
Time is a very precious thing, and when you're living a nomad's life hopping from country to country, it can be easy to lose track of it. Well fear no longer. Introducing TravelTime+, the new application that allows you to keep track of how much time you've spent in any particular country! Just select a country date, an arrival date, and a departure date, and let TravelTime+ do the rest. 

This is a rework of an application that I had previously made that utilised the PySimpleGui module. Since that has depreciated (as has my access token) I've reworked it utilising the far superior PyQt6!
